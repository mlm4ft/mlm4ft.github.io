        <h2>A reflection on my career</h2>
        <p>
        Librarianship is a second career for me, but it is also a continuation. I have worked in higher education for more than 20 years, and hope to continue doing so. The first decade and a half of that were in computer support. That position aligned with my skills, more than my interests. I was able to do the job effectively, though I found it less and less rewarding as time went on. As I was looking for alternate career paths, the library was one possibility that I considered. So when a library position opened at a nearby college, I took the leap.
        </p>
        <p>
        The technical aspects of library work have been a stimulating change of pace. But more than that, I’ve found myself drawn to the culture of librarianship itself. While at my previous position, I began taking courses for a Library and Information Services certificate. Before even completing the certificate, I knew that I was ready to go further, and so applied for a graduate program in the field. This May, I will complete my Master’s of Library and Information Science.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the meantime, I have also transitioned from that initial position to one working full time in library systems administration. I am now more involved with the medium- and long-term decision making in the library. Being in an academic library has also allowed me to deepen my theoretical and scholastic interests in the field. I have attended several conferences, and had one article published.
        </p>
        <p>
        My current goal is a faculty librarian position, and I believe my recent accomplishments are steps in that direction. I would like to find a tenure-track position. This would allow me even greater involvement in the management of the library, as well as deeper support for scholastic pursuits within the field.
