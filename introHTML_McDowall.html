    Hin everyone. My name is Matt McDowall, and this is my final semester in the MLIS program here at Mizzou. I have a previous Master's in American Studies, and I currently work in the library at the University of Nebraska - Kearney. I actually have a bit of HTML/web experience, but I've never taken a class in it. My expectation for the course is simply to create a site from the bottom up, and systematically learn HTML &amp; CSS in order to fill in gaps in my previous knowledge. My favorite hobby is studying languages (currently French, Spanish, and Russian). I also really enjoy photography, and I hope to have time to return to it once I complete my Master's in May.
